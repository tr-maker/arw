Code to compute the stationary distribution for the activated random walk on a connected simple graph with one sink vertex.

stationary_dist.py performs the computation and saves the result as a pickle.

stationary_dist_analysis.py reads in the pickle and analyzes it.

solver.py and progressbar.py are helper programs used for stationary_dist.py and are created by Hannah Cairns.
